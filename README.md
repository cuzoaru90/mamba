# Glass Mamba Site

This is a web page intended to be used as a portfolio for Don Kada, who aspires to be a freelance 
developer. 

Chuck Uzoaru used RAW code to create a substantial amount of the website simply from looking at a mockup. Don Kada 
heavily refined the code over the later phases of the project, so the work is ultimately attributed to him. Chuck
devoted several hours to project, and he learned new skills and techniques during this time.
